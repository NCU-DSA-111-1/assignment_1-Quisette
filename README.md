# DSA Homework #1 XOR Operator Training Program Using Neural Network

## Compile 

Please change your terminal directory into this folder, and execute the following command: 

     make main
## Execute

After compiling, please execute the following command:

    ./main 

## Usage 

When entering, the program will show  

    
    Welcome to this program. Please choose the mode you want to execute this program.
    Enter 1 to show quadratic loss of the training process.
    Enter 2 to enter custom string and show the XOR checksum based on NN learning output.
    >>

Please enter the number corresponding to the function to use. 

### Function 1: Quadratic Loss 

After choosing this function, the program will then suggest user to enter iteration time and the interval of reporting. The result will be shown on the console.

### Function 2: User-Defined String Binary Parity Checksum validator

After choosing this function, the program will then suggest user to enter iteration time and the string to generate binary parity checksum. 
The screen will then show the checksum generated by XOR operator directly in main library and 
the checksum generated XOR operator learned by neural network training.
