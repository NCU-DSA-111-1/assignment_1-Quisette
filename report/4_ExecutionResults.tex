	\section{Execution Results}
	Below is one sample I/O of the program. Note that the input with \lstinline{>>} is user input. 
	 \begin{lstlisting}[language=,caption=Main Program Execution Result]
Welcome to this program. Please choose the mode you want to execute this program.
Enter 1 to show quadratic loss of the training process.
Enter 2 to enter custom string and show the XOR checksum based on NN learning output.
>>2
Please enter the training iteration. (integer)
The training result would be better if trained for 5000 times for 1 layer with 2 nodes per layer.
>>5000
Training Result: 0 1 1 0 
If the result is not "0 1 1 0 ", please consider increase the iteration count or try rerun this program.
Please enter a string. This Program will output the XOR checksum of this string.
>>test_string

Checksum by XOR operator: 0
Checksum generated by neural network: 0   \end{lstlisting}
